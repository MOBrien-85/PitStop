// okay so this will be a container. in how the reviews are fetched from the dom
// and then displayed. but these will be routed to the customer profile display

// nevertheless the block has an edit and delete button


// here i will populate a user's reviews 
// i need it to create the framework for the review visual. a card.
// similar in style to the exit cards that have a corresponding color dot in the
// upper left corner. 
// it should access the exitReviews array
// then i have those numbers averaged for the jsx to reference.
// then import it to the profile.


// okay this is more complicated than i thought
// i also need the interstate and exit id. which i've still not quite figured out
// how that gets determined in the review -> api thing. once i do-no problem
// i access the rating object, and the review list on the profile is just
// mapping over that user's reviews. 
// i think i need a seperate container for the structure of the thumbnail card thought




// this will capture all the reviews -- importing the review.js module--and then if it is the current user
// these will be exported--routed to profile.js
